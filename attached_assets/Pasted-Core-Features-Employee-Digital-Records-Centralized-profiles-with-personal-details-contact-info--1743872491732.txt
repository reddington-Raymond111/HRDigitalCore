Core Features:

Employee Digital Records: Centralized profiles with personal details, contact info, attachments (IDs, diplomas), and work history.

Org & Position Management: Tree-structured department hierarchy, role definitions (headcount, reporting lines), and real-time updates.

Hiring/Transfer/Exit Workflows: Standardized processes (onboarding, promotions, offboarding) with templates (e.g., contract generation) and configurable approval steps.

Contract & Document Tracking: Automated alerts for contract/certificate renewals, OCR-enabled search, and digital archiving.

Salary & Promotions: Maintain pay grades, log adjustments, and sync with payroll modules.

Benefits & Social Insurance: Track社保/公积金 (social insurance/provident fund) details and other perks for payroll compliance.

Employee Self-Service: Read-only access to personal/organization data, with editable fields (e.g., address) requiring HR approval.

Role-Based Security: Granular permissions (e.g., managers view only their team), audit logs, and data encryption for sensitive fields (salaries, IDs).

Technical Architecture (On-Premise):

Three-tier design with a central relational database (open-source, encrypted) shared across HR modules.

RESTful APIs enable real-time data sync (e.g., with payroll/performance systems).

Supports LAN/VPN access, LDAP/AD integration, and automated alerts (e.g., onboarding emails).

Scalable for growth (hardware upgrades/read-write splitting) with low-maintenance deployment (scripts, backups).

Design Principles:

Comprehensive & Accurate: Prebuilt compliance features (e.g., labor contract templates, ID validation).

User-Friendly: Intuitive UI (org charts, smart defaults) and minimal manual input.

Flexible: Custom fields/modules (e.g., hide社保 for international staff).

Secure & Compliant: Role-based access, audit trails, and local law adherence (e.g., contract renewal alerts).

Integrated: Single data source for all HR modules to prevent silos.

Low-Maintenance: Excel imports, config wizards, and auto-alerts for data upkeep.
